# Developing Ocular

### Install dependencies

Install and configure the following dependencies on your machine to build Ocular.

- [Git](http://git-scm.com/)
- [Node.js v18.x (LTS)](http://nodejs.org)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) version 9.x.x
- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) (to run studio locally)

## Local development

Ocular uses [Turborepo](https://turborepo.org/docs).

### Fork the repo

To contribute code to Ocular, you must fork the [Ocular repo](https://github.com/OcularEngineering/ocular).

### Clone the repo

1. Clone your GitHub forked repo:

   ```sh
   git clone your-forked-repo-ocular-repo

   ```

2. Go to the Ocular directory:

   ```sh
   cd ocular
   ```

### Install dependencies

1. Install the dependencies in the root of the repo.

```sh
   npm install # install dependencies
```

2. Install the dependencies in the root of the repo.

```sh
   npm install -g turbo # install dependencies
```

### Starting the Backend

1. Build repo with turbo.

   ```sh
      turbo build
   ```

2. Copy the example `env.dev.example` to `.env.dev`

   ```sh
      cp env.dev.example packages/ocular/.env.dev
   ```

3. Navigate to Ocular Dir

   ```sh
      cd packages/ocular/
   ```

4. Configure .env with app and plugin secrets of the apps and plugins you want to connect.

   - Azure Keys are **required** since they allow Ocular to connect to an LLM Service

   ```sh
      AZURE_OPEN_AI_KEY=
      AZURE_OPEN_AI_ENDPOINT=
      AZURE_OPEN_AI_EMBEDDER_DEPLOYMENT_NAME=
      AZURE_OPEN_AI_EMBEDDING_MODEL=
      AZURE_OPEN_AI_CHAT_DEPLOYMENT_NAME=
      AZURE_OPEN_AI_CHAT_MODEL=
   ```

   - Additional ApiKeys for other apps are optionnal but needed if you intend to connect Ocular to other apps.

5. Run Postgress DB + Redis + QDrant in Docker

```sh
   docker compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml up
```

6. Start the backend.

```sh
   npm run start # start the backend
```

### Start UI

1. Navigate to Ocular UI in "packages/ocular-ui".

   ```sh
      cd packages/ocular/
   ```

2. Install front end dependencies with the following command.

   ```sh
      npm install --legacy-peer-deps # start all the applications
   ```

3. After that you can start the front end with the following.

   ```sh
      npm run dev
   ```

Then visit the following sites:

| Site                                   | Directory             | Scope name | Description | Local development server             |
| -------------------------------------- | --------------------- | ---------- | ----------- | ------------------------------------ |
| [useocular.com](https://useocular.com) | `/packages/ocular-ui` | front-end  | Ocular UI   | http://localhost:3001/create-account |

# Start Web UI for Docker Postgres Container üê≥

Follow these steps to get the web UI up and running for your Dockerized Postgres container.

## 1. Start the Docker Container

Use the command below to start your Docker container:

```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml up
```

## 2. Access the Web UI

Visit the following URL in your web browser to access the web UI:

üåê http://localhost:5050/login?next=/browser/

## Here's the login page you should see:

![Login Page](/img/pg_signin.png)

## 3. Login Credentials

Use the following credentials to log in:

- Email: ocularpostgres@useocular.com
- Password: ocular

Get container ID for postgres

```sh
docker ps
```

Get container IP address using `postgres_container_id` which something looks like `17x.xx.x.x` at the bottom of the response

```sh
docker inspect <postgres_container_id>
```

## 4. Create a new server and connect to container

![server connection](/img/pg_connection.png)

üöÄ Click save ! You should now be able to access the PostgreSQL management interface and manage your databases directly from your browser! |

#### Shared components

The monorepo components are under `/packages`:

- `/packages/apps`: Connectors To DataSources for Knowledge Indexing (Asana, Notion, GitHub etc)
- `/packages/ocular-ui`: UI Dashboard for Ocular.
- `/packages/ocular`: Backend for Ocular which Ingests Apps and Plugins.
- `/packages/plugins`: Plugin's That Allow Ocular to access services such as VectorDBS, LLMModels etc
- `/packages/types`: Shared data types shared across Ocular Modules
- `/packages/utils`: Shared Utils aross Ocular Modules

#### Installing packages

Installing a package with NPM workspaces requires you to add the `-w` flag to tell NPM which workspace you want to install into. Do not install dependencies in their local folder, install them from the route using the `-w` flag.

The format is: `npm install <package name> -w=<workspace to install in>`.

For example:

- `npm install react -w ocular-ui`: installs into `./packages/ocular-ui`
- `npm install react -w ocular`: installs into `./packages/ocular`
