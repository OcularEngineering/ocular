# Tasks App

ðŸš¨ This app is under active development. ðŸš¨

Tasks App is a sample Task Management app built on the [Slack Platform](https://api.slack.com). To learn more about it, check out this [blog post](https://slack.com/intl/en-ie/blog/developers/sharpen-development-skills-tasks-app) or watch this ongoing series of videos on [YouTube](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLWlXaxtQ7fUb0B4uNTKirvrQ0JOTCBFae).

As Tasks App is a tool designed to teach you about the Slack Platform, we don't currently offer a hosted version. If you're looking for a project management tool for your organisation, check out the many options available on our [App Directory](https://my.slack.com/apps/category/At0EFY3MJ4-project-management).

If you want to see the app in action, there's some screenshots below, or you can clone the repo and run it locally.
