        "content": "The system consists of three main threads: the AnalysisThread (or Producer), the PatternIdRequestThread (or Consumer), and the ResultPersistenceThread. The AnalysisThread reads an input file, parses its contents, and generates patterns. These patterns are then placed into a queue for further processing. The PatternIdRequestThread dequeues patterns from the queue, sends them to a database via a C++ client, and assigns each pattern a unique identifier returned by the database. Meanwhile, the ResultPersistenceThread handles additional tasks, including database interactions, ensuring that the system operates smoothly. Each thread plays a crucial role in the overall functionality of the system, with the AnalysisThread generating patterns, the PatternIdRequestThread managing database communication, and the ResultPersistenceThread providing additional support while maintaining efficient CPU usage.",
